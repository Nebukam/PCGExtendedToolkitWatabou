# PCG Extended Toolkit + Watabou

![PCGEx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nebukam/PCGExtendedToolkit/refs/heads/docs/_sources/smol-logo.png)

## Purpose of Plugin

This **experimental** Watabou plugin allows to convert JSON exports of [Watabou Generators](https://watabou.itch.io/) into PCG & [PCG Extended Toolkit](https://nebukan.github.io/PCGExtendedToolkit) data.

## EXPERIMENTAL Status

PCGExtendedToolkitWatabou (this plugin) is **experimental** code. Watabou JSON data structure may change over time and it may stop working without me noticing. If that's the case, create an issue and I'll look into the changes; the code is designed to support multiple data versions, starting with the latest at the time of creating this plugin.

## Getting Started

TBD
